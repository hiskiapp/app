  <p>Hi everyone, I will share my experience applying these five ways and how they helped me develop myself in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bangkit-academy/">Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, &amp; Traveloka</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ways-of-interacting">Ways of Interacting</h3>
<p>When I first joined Bangkit, I looked for new friends through various social media platforms such as Discord, Twitter, and others. In addition, Bangkit also requires the use of English in its activities. Initially, I had difficulty communicating in English. However, to overcome this, I used to consume English-language content, such as reading articles and watching videos. Now, I am relatively easy to interact with using English.</p>
<h3 id="ways-of-achieving">Ways of Achieving</h3>
<p>When joining Bangkit, I aimed to develop my technical skills in Machine Learning. To achieve this, I attended all mandatory sessions and took the opportunity to interact with fellow Bangkit Cohort and Mentors.</p>
<h3 id="ways-of-learning">Ways of Learning</h3>
<p>One of the Ways of learning I apply is to learn more about the topic before the learning session begins. By doing this, I can prepare myself well and better understand the material to be discovered. In addition, I also use my experience and connect it with the topics being learned. This way, I can strengthen my understanding of the topic and make it more relevant to daily life.</p>
<h3 id="ways-of-working">Ways of Working</h3>
<p>One of the Ways of working I apply is to learn in the early morning. I can focus better and away from distractions at this time. To implement this habit, I forced myself to sleep earlier, even though I used to stay up late. In addition, I also use time management methods such as the Eisenhower Matrix to set priorities for my tasks. By doing this, I can maximize the available time and improve my work productivity.</p>
<h3 id="ways-of-thinking">Ways of Thinking</h3>
<p>At the beginning of Bangkit, I attended the first mandatory session that discussed growth mindset. At that time, I realized that I was more prone to having a fixed mindset than a growth mindset. However, the session opened my mind and helped me understand that a growth mindset also includes accepting criticism with an open mind, having confidence, and taking risks. Since then, I have tried to adopt a growth mindset. With a growth mindset, I can continue to learn and grow.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Through the five ways of adapting, I have learned to interact with like-minded individuals, set achievable goals, prepare for learning sessions, work efficiently, and adopt a growth mindset. These skills have helped me not only in the program but also in my personal and professional life.</p>
